/*Build up the caesar( input, shift, encode ) function:

input is a string that refers to the inputted text to be encoded or decoded.
shift is an integer refers to how much each letter is "shifted" by. 
  A positive number means shifting to the right (i.e. "A" with a shift of 3 becomes "D") whereas a 
  negative number means shifting to the left (i.e. "M" with a shift of 3 becomes "K").
encode is a boolean that refers to whether you should encode or decode the message. 
  By default, it is set to true.


true
"bad"
